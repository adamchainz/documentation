# Welcome

Bring your repository to life with CodeHerald.


## What is it?

CodeHerald listens to events in your Github repository, compares them against
rules that you create and executes actions when there's a match.

See the [Quick start](#) guide for more details.

## How does it work?

1. Sign-up to CodeHerald with your Github account.
2. Create a repository on CodeHerald. It will generate a webhook url.
3. Register webhook url, from step #2, in your Github repository settings. You
   can control which events are sent to CodeHerald.
4. Create rules on CodeHerald to trigger actions.

Voila! Based on the events CodeHerald receives - it will trigger the actions.
